# Veltrix

Veltrix is a **Kanban board project** I’m building to practice and explore **Next.js App Router, Supabase, TailwindCSS, and modern frontend patterns**.  
It’s not meant for production or commercial use — this is mainly a **learning project** to understand how to design and structure an enterprise-style app.

## Purpose

- Practice **full-stack development** (frontend + backend API routes).
- Learn **authentication and RBAC** with Supabase.
- Explore **real-time features** using WebSockets.
- Get hands-on with **UI/UX design** using TailwindCSS.
- Build something portfolio-worthy to demonstrate architecture & coding style.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Database & Auth**: Supabase
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Data Fetching**: SWR
